# Intro

I have found that one of the best supplements to learning a language is
to read that community's style guide. This style guide is inspired by
one of my favorite ones, the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/turbosquid/ruby-style-guide)
by @bbatsov. I hope this guide, like the Ruby Style Guide, will benefit
the community of Swift developers by being a reference for community-driven
coding styles, idioms and practices.

We can make an excellent resource to inspire the current and next-generation
of iOS developers out there, so keep submitting those suggestions.

# The Swift Style Guide

This style guide acts as a collection of recommendations of actual
programming practices by Swift programmers to such that they can write
maintainable, yet enjoyable, Swift code.

Rules and suggestions have a rationale included unless it is obvious.

The guide is a living document, so please contribute. If you find an area
that lacks detail (or examples), or an area that is completely missing,
please improve it!

You can generate a PDF or an HTML copy of this guide using
